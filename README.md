# pg-gan-mosquito

This software is an implementation of pg_gan on non-model species, to simulate data that replicate real population anopheles genetic data. It implements a GAN-based algorithm (Generative Adversarial Network) described in the paper Automatic inference of demographic parameters using Generative Adversarial Networks.

##environments
The created environments can be found in the environments folder. tf_env_requirements.txt is used for deep learning related processes such as pg_gan.py and demographic_selection_oop.py. pg-gan_env.yml is used for creating summary statistics plots, ABC rejection analysis and other utility functions.
